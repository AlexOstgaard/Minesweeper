# Minesweeper
I made my own version of minesweeper, just to challenge myself, and understand the code behind the "simple" but very stimulating web game.

This is my first ever project that I am publishing to GitHub. I wrote most of the program in 2022/2023, but I did not realise that I should share it somewhere, so it has just been on my computer for a while. Hopefully many other more exciting projects will follow.
